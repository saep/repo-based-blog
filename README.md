# repo-based-blog

A blogging module that uses a repository as its content backend.

# Usage

The Haddock documentation of the module `Web.RBB` should contain enough
information to get started.

# Contributing

As long as there are no web application specific changes required, I would
usually just review and accept every pull request.

## Guidelines

* Please write documentation!
* Please try to write tests!
* If an issue exists, reference it!
* Similar to neovim's development, use [WIP], [RFC] and [RDY] as tags in
  pull requests. Especially the [WIP] annotation has the potential to avoid
  unnecessary duplicate work if the pull request is created immediately
  after starting to work at the issue.
