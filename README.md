Toy blogging website that I am occasionally working on.

# Contributing

This is essentially just a reminder for myself as to how I want
contributions to be made. I want to keep the feature-set small for now and
get the prototype running first.

## Guidelines

* Please write documentation!
* Please try to write tests!
* Please annotate commits with [Test] or [Doc] to indicate their domain,
  leave it empty for commits targeted at the core functionality. This is
  very helpful to spot commit that are interesting.
* If an issue exists, reference it!
* Similar to neovim's development, use [WIP], [RFC] and [RDY] as tags in
  pull requests. Especially the [WIP] annotation has the potential to avoid
  unnecessary duplicate work if the pull request is created immediately
  after starting to work at the issue.
